# Hey 👋

My name is Gabriela Viana. 👩🏻‍🦱🇧🇷

I am an Advertiser and events producer who is currently in a career transition on Generation Brazil’s Java Junior Developer Bootcamp to become a programmer. 💻

As I have been working in events since 2011, what I do best is solving problems and working under pressure. I have always defined myself as a fast learner and now, after having started the Bootcamp, I can say it with propriety.
The word my friends use to describe me is versatile, because I am always reinventing myself. I am not afraid to face new challenges and big changes.

### 🌍 "Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever." 🧠
