# Hey 👋🏻

My name is Gabriela Viana. 👩🏻‍🦱🇧🇷

Passionate about learning, I am embracing the opportunities of creativity and technology in web development that can truly benefit lives.

I decided in a career change and gained a place in the Generation Brazil Bootcamp, opening a world of technology to me that can be used to support and develop businesses. This was a great program, learning Java with object-oriented programming, consolidated by developing the Back-End using Rest API on Spring Boot (STS), Java Persistence API Jpa to map the Database with MySQL (PhpMyAdmin & Workbench), testing RESTful services using Postman and documenting with Swagger. To complete the full-stack process, I learnt Angular for consuming the data backend ready with Spring Boot using TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap.

I have brought forward my skills in communication, teamwork, problems solving, decision making, project management and working under pressure from my previous career, complementing these by having just studied Scrum and Kanban as Agile Methodologies, all proving indispensable as I go forward.

This new chapter in my life is making my eyes shine with excitement and passion.
